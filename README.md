![Spectrogram Image](media/synerise-ai-article-fourier.png)

## üöÄ Introduction

This code provides a Python function to compute the spectrogram of an input signal using PyTorch on a GPU. The spectrogram represents the power spectrum of the input signal as it varies over time. Spectrograms are widely used in various domains, including audio processing, speech recognition, music analysis, and signal processing.

The function utilizes the power of PyTorch and GPU acceleration to efficiently compute the spectrogram, allowing for faster processing of large datasets. It offers flexibility in terms of customizable parameters such as window size, hop size, and FFT points, allowing you to tailor the spectrogram computation to your specific requirements.

## üìã Usage

To use the `compute_spectrogram` function, follow these steps:

1. Install the required dependencies:
   - Python 3.x
   - PyTorch
   - Matplotlib (for visualization)

2. Import the necessary modules:
   ```python
   import torch
   from compute_spectrogram import compute_spectrogram
   ```

3. Define your input signal as a list or NumPy array and specify the sample rate:
   ```python
   input_vector = [...]  # Your input vector
   sample_rate = 44100  # Sample rate of the input vector
   ```

4. Call the `compute_spectrogram` function, passing the input signal and sample rate:
   ```python
   time_axis, frequency_axis, power_spectrogram = compute_spectrogram(input_vector, sample_rate)
   ```

5. The function will return the computed power spectrogram as a NumPy array, along with the corresponding time axis and frequency axis. You can use these arrays for further analysis or visualization.

## üéµ Examples

The code provides three example usages to help you understand how to compute and visualize spectrograms:

1. **General Usage:**
   ```python
   input_vector = [...]  # Your input vector
   sample_rate = 44100  # Sample rate of the input vector
   window_size = 1024  # Size of the analysis window (in samples)
   hop_size = 512  # Hop size (in samples)
   n_fft = 1024  # Number of FFT bins
   time_axis, frequency_axis, power_spectrogram = compute_spectrogram(input_vector, sample_rate, window_size, hop_size, n_fft)
   ```

2. **Synthetic Signal Usage:**
   ```python
   # Generate a sample signal
   fs = 2  # Sample rate (Hz)
   t = np.arange(0, 180, 1/fs)  # Time vector
   f1 = 0.8  # Frequency of the signal
   sig = np.sin(2 * np.pi * f1 * t)

   # Compute spectrogram
   time_axis, frequency_axis, power_spectrogram = compute_spectrogram(input_vector=sig, sample_rate=2, window_type="hann")

   # Visualize the spectrogram
   plt.plot(frequency_axis, power_spectrogram)
   plt.xlabel('Frequency')
   plt.ylabel('Power Spectrum')
   plt.show()
   ```

3. **Synthetic Signal with Visualization:**
   ```python
   fs = 10e3
   N = 1e5
   amp = 2 * np.sqrt(2)
   noise_power = 0.01 * fs / 2
   time = np.arange(N) / float(fs)
   mod = 500*np.cos(2*np.pi*0.25*time)
   carrier = amp * np.sin(2*np.pi*3e3*time + mod)
   rng = np.random.default_rng()
   noise = rng.normal(scale=np.sqrt(noise_power), size=time.shape)
   noise *= np.exp(-time/5)
   x = carrier + noise

   # Compute and visualize the spectrogram
   time_axis, frequency_axis, power_spectrogram = compute_spectrogram(input_vector=x, sample_rate=fs, window_size=3*60, hop_size=2*60, n_fft=3*60, window_type="hann")
   fig, ax = plt.subplots(figsize=(10,6))
   plt.pcolormesh(time_axis, frequency_axis, power_spectrogram, shading='gouraud', cmap="turbo")
   ax.tick_params(axis='x', rotation=45, labelsize=13)
   ax.tick_params(axis='y', rotation=45, labelsize=13)
   ax.set_xlabel("Time [sec]", fontsize=15)
   ax.set_ylabel("Frequency [Hz]", fontsize=15)
   ax.grid(False)
   plt.show()
   ```
